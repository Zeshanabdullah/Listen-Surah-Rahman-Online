## 🌿 Why We Built This (Personal Note)
I started this because I needed SURAH RAHMAN in a calm, honest place.  
One evening, stressed and distracted, I played a recitation. After a few verses, my chest felt lighter. It was small, but real. That moment led me to build this site and this repo.

I wanted a place with:
- NO ADS  
- NO REDIRECTS  
- FAST, DIRECT ACCESS

So, I made this. I hope it helps you find the same calm I found.
